# Minesweeper_Game

### Upon running the program, random mines are generated, but their locations are unknown to the player. As the user clicks boxes, the program either:
#### A. displays a number in the box chosen by the user, indicating the number of mines touching the box. 
#### B. clears the box chosen by the user because it was not touching any mines and loops until all boxes touching the box contain numbers.
#### C. displays an X in the chosen box (indicating the player hit a mine), displays all locations of mines, and sends a game over message. 

### I used tools from both Java.awt and Java.swing in this creation, including BorderLayout and GridLayout, ActionEvent and ActionListener, JButton, JFrame, and JOptionPane, and MouseEvent and MouseListener.
